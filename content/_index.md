# Hello there :wave:

I am Adrien, a software engineer passionate about embedded systems, home
automation, and cybersecurity.

I am currently employed at [Rtone][rtone], as an Embedded Software Engineer for
Linux devices. My daily activities there led me work closely with tools such as
the [Yocto Project][yocto], [Docker][docker], [U-Boot][uboot], [QEMU][qemu], and
[Azure IoT][azure-iot]. I have also had the opportunity to improve my DevOps
skills, by using [Ansible][ansible] to help improve the internal infrastructure,
and [Azure Devops][azure-devops] to create CI/CD pipelines used to test, build,
and deploy the code we write.

In 2020, I obtained a Master's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering from
the [Pennsylvania State University][psu]. During this degree, I was a member of
the Systems and Internet Infrastructure Security Laboratory, under the advising
of [Pr. Patrick McDaniel][mcdaniel].

During my stay in the SIIS Lab, my research focus was on Intrusion Detection
Systems for Internet of Things (IoT) environments. As part of my research, I
built a framework that aims at detecting discrepancies between physical and
logical state in a device, in order to identify potential malicious activity.
The results of this work can be found [in my thesis][thesis].

Before joining Penn State, I obtained an Engineer's Degree from the [École
Centrale de Lyon][ecl], which I attended after completing my two years of classe
préparatoire at the Lycée Saint-Louis.
