I am Adrien, a Software Engineer passionate about aerospace, embedded systems, and cybersecurity. In
2020, I obtained a Master's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the Pennsylvania State
University.
During this degree, I was a member of the Systems and Internet Infrastructure
Security Laboratory, under the
advising of .

During my stay in the SIIS Lab, my research focus was on Intrusion Detection Systems for Internet of Things
